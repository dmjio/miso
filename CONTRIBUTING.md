## When making PR's
  - Do fork `master`
  - Do rebase `sqaush` / `fixup` as you see fit (so as to keep changes atomic)
  - Do include documentation (where applicable)
  - Do include tests (where applicable)
  - Don't bump the package version, that will be handled when a release is made
  - Don't just make one-off formatting or stylistic changes (i.e. rearrange the deck chairs)
  - Do have fun, use emojis :ramen:
