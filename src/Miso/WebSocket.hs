data CloseCode
  = CLOSE_NORMAL
   -- ^ 1000, Normal closure; the connection successfully completed whatever purpose for which it was created.
  | CLOSE_GOING_AWAY
   -- ^ 1001, The endpoint is going away, either because of a server failure or because the browser is navigating away from the page that opened the connection.
  | CLOSE_PROTOCOL_ERROR
   -- ^ 1002, The endpoint is terminating the connection due to a protocol error.
  | CLOSE_UNSUPPORTED
   -- ^ 1003, The connection is being terminated because the endpoint received data of a type it cannot accept (for example, a textonly endpoint received binary data).
  | CLOSE_NO_STATUS
   -- ^ 1005, Reserved.  Indicates that no status code was provided even though one was expected.
  | CLOSE_ABNORMAL
   -- ^ 1006, Reserved. Used to indicate that a connection was closed abnormally (that is, with no close frame being sent) when a status code is expected.
  | Unsupported_Data
   -- ^ 1007, The endpoint is terminating the connection because a message was received that contained inconsistent data (e.g., nonUTF8 data within a text message).
  | Policy_Violation
   -- ^ 1008, The endpoint is terminating the connection because it received a message that violates its policy. This is a generic status code, used when codes 1003 and 1009 are not suitable.
  | CLOSE_TOO_LARGE
   -- ^ 1009, The endpoint is terminating the connection because a data frame was received that is too large.
  | Missing_Extension
   -- ^ 1010, The client is terminating the connection because it expected the server to negotiate one or more extension, but the server didn't.
  | Internal_Error
   -- ^ 1011, The server is terminating the connection because it encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
  | Service_Restart
   -- ^ 1012, The server is terminating the connection because it is restarting.
  | Try_Again_Later
   -- ^ 1013, The server is terminating the connection due to a temporary condition, e.g. it is overloaded and is casting off some of its clients.
  | TLS_Handshake
   -- ^ 1015, Reserved. Indicates that the connection was closed due to a failure to perform a TLS handshake (e.g., the server certificate can't be verified).
  | OtherCode Int
   -- ^ OtherCode that is reserved and not in the range 0999
