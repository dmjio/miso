-- | A monad for succinctly expressing model transitions in the 'update' function.
--
-- @Transition@ is a state monad so it abstracts over manually passing the model
-- around. It's also a writer monad where the accumulator is a list of scheduled
-- IO actions. Multiple actions can be scheduled using
-- @Control.Monad.Writer.Class.tell@ from the @mtl@ library and a single action
-- can be scheduled using 'scheduleIO'.
--
-- Tip: use the @Transition@ monad in combination with the stateful
-- <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-4.15.4/docs/Control-Lens-Operators.html lens>
-- operators (all operators ending in "@=@"). The following example assumes
-- the lenses @field1@, @counter@ and @field2@ are in scope and that the
-- @LambdaCase@ language extension is enabled:
--
-- @
-- myApp = App
--   { update = 'fromTransition' . \\case
--       MyAction1 -> do
--         field1 .= value1
--         counter += 1
--       MyAction2 -> do
--         field2 %= f
--         scheduleIO $ do
--           putStrLn \"Hello\"
--           putStrLn \"World!\"
--   , ...
--   }

-- about their results or when they complete.

scheduleIOFor_ :: Foldable f => JSM (f action) -> Transition action model ()
scheduleIOFor_ io = scheduleSub $ \sink -> io >>= \m -> liftIO (for_ m sink)

-- | Like 'scheduleIO' but schedules a subscription which is an IO
-- computation that has access to a 'Sink' which can be used to
-- asynchronously dispatch actions to the 'update' function.
--
-- A use-case is scheduling an IO computation which creates a
-- 3rd-party JS widget which has an associated callback. The callback
-- can then call the sink to turn events into actions. To do this
-- without accessing a sink requires going via a @'Sub'scription@
-- which introduces a leaky-abstraction.
