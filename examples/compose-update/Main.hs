-- We are going to use 'Lens'es in this example. Since @miso@ does not
-- depend on a lens library we are going to define a couple of

-- you depend on a lens library such as @lens@ or @microlens@ to get
-- these definitions.

-- | You can find this under the same name in @lens@ and

-- synonym for 'traverseOf'.

-- In this example we are only going to use this when applied to
-- 'Lens' m a' and using 'Effect Action' for the @f@ type variable. In
-- that case the specialized type signature is:
--
-- @traverseOf :: Functor f => Lens' m a -> (a -> Effect Action a) -> s -> Effect action s
traverseOf :: Functor f => Lens s t a b -> (a -> f b) -> s -> f t
traverseOf = id

-- @microlens@ provide this under the same name.

_1 f (a,c) = (,c) <$> f a

-- | A lens into the second element of a tuple. Both @lens@ and
-- @microlens@ provide this under the same name.
_2 :: Lens (c,a) (c,b) a b
_2 f (c,a) = (c,) <$> f a

-- | Update function for the second counter in our 'Model'. As weâ€™ve
-- mentioned before, this counter is decremented when the first
-- counter is incremented and the other way around.
updateSecondCounter :: Action -> Int -> Effect Action Int
updateSecondCounter Increment m = noEff (m - 1)
updateSecondCounter Decrement m = noEff (m + 1)
